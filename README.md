# Benefits for Merchants
Security Pro is the industry leader in PrestaShop security modules. It’s the most advanced PrestaShop security module on the market. The module will automatically scan your website for common threats. You will be alerted if any signs of a security breach are detected with the instructions to fix them. The module can add additional layers of security to your PrestaShop website that will benefit in case someone attacks your website. Security Lite is a free version that includes some of the features.

PrestaShop in its own is very secure. It's among the most secure content management systems available. When said, its good practice to add extra layers of security. I added all these layers as features so you can enable them without any coding knowledge to follow best practice.

# Other
Is the module using overrides?
The module does not use overrides and none of the core-files is modified, so you are completely safe against conflicts between other modules.
As this is an all-in-one module, you don’t need a bunch of security modules that could be conflicting. All the features in this module are built to work together.

## Can I try the module?
There is a live demo of the module, so you can try it. This is highly recommended as some features are better explained in the demo.
If you have questions don't hesitate to contact me. Link to live demo: https://reker.dk/demo/admin-dev

## Will the module affect the performance of the website?
The code quality is high and it follows PrestaShop's guidelines. The code is optimized for performance, but in theory, any code will affect the performance.
The firewall rules can have a very little effect on the performance due to some external lookups. These lookups are cached, so they do not get repeated for the same client. I doubt you could find a real-world scenario where that difference matters.
Other than that, it will not affect noticeably performance in the front office at all.
All of the firewall settings are configurable — the less aggressive, the more performance.

## Will this module fix a hacked website?
If you got infected by malware, it is better to upload a backup from before you got infected and then secure your website with Security Pro.
Due to the analysis tools of the module, the module can find vulnerabilities on and alert you if any signs of a security breach are detected with the instructions to fix them.

## Will this module affect SEO?
The module is SEO friendly and none of the features in this module can harm your ranking.
Google is excluded from the firewall rules, so Google will not get blocked in any way.
